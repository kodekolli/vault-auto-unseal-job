Vault is a secrets management tool, which encrypts and stores credentials, API keys, and other secrets for use in distributed systems. So, the availability of vault is very crucial.
python code will monitor the vault seal status every 10 minutes(change according to your requirement) and unseal if it is sealed.
This code works on vault running on the Kubernetes cluster.

To run the python code in the K8 cluster, you need a custom image. Build the new image with the Dockerfile.

Once the image is built, use that image in the K8 cronjob. Use the yaml and create the cronjob.
Before creating the YAML, you need to create a configmap of the python code and namespace kubeconfig.

kubectl create cm script --from-file=<path_to_unseal.py>
kubectl create cm k8config --from-file=<path_to_k8config>


Expected output:

172.25.20.11
http://172.25.20.11:8200
The vault is not sealed!
172.25.20.7
http://172.25.20.7:8200
The vault is not sealed!
172.25.20.9
http://172.25.20.9:8200
The vault is not sealed!
